cache_query
===========

Introduction
------------
cache_query is an experimental (and buggy) framework for simple cache access
benchmarks on C programs.

In order to write a benchmark, include your C program inside of the `test'
directory and annotate it accordingly. For instance,

    1   //! var variantName_16: -DCOLS=16 -DHELLO
    2   //! var variantName_32: -DCOLS=32 -DEXAMPLE

Note that the syntax for variant specification is as follows:
    
    //! var <identificator>_<number>: <extra CFLAGS>

The supplied <number> will be the value of the X axis in the generated plot,
while the Y axis will hold the cache miss rate captured during execution.

Hacking
-------
cache_query relies on the perf_event_open(2) system call for counting hardware
performance events (PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_MISSES and PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_REFERENCES
as of now). Refer to the cache_query.c file in order to add or remove performance
counters.

The current code for reading child process events is somewhat buggy, and may not
be indicative of the real state of the executing process. Don't use cache_query
for production or mission-critical systems.
